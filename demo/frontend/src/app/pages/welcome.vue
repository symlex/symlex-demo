                A lean framework stack for agile Web development based on Symfony and Vuetify
            </h1>
            <p class="body-1">
                Symlex is designed to be simple with few concepts to understand - so that you can start implementing
                instead of wasting time on Stack Overflow.
                Since its first release in 2014, it has proven to be well suited for rapidly building microservices, CLI
                and single-page applications. It comes
                complete with working examples from testing to forms and database abstraction. Simply delete what you
                don't need.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://github.com/symlex/di-microkernel" target="_blank">kernel</a> is extremely lean and only creates a
                service container for bootstrapping your application within its context.
                Using a single container for configuration and dependency injection reduces complexity and leads to
                improved performance compared to other frameworks.
                It also prevents developers from thoughtlessly installing bundles without understanding
                them. The result is less bloat and simpler, more maintainable and testable code that is fundamental for
                agile development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Plain classes are used wherever possible to avoid vendor lock-in and enable framework independent code
                reuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can combine the PHP based backend with any JavaScript library or REST client.
                The front-end boilerplate is there for your convenience and puts you straight on track for building
                impressive single-page applications with Webpack and Vuetify.
                A working example for command line applications is included as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                After executing <code>bin/phing dev</code> in a terminal, you can sign in as &quot;admin@example.com&quot;
                using the password &quot;passwd&quot; to access the <router-link to="/users">user management</router-link>.
                See <code>build.xml</code> for more commands.
                Running <code>composer update</code> will get you the latest updates, clears the cache and automatically
                rebuilds the composer autoloader classmap.
                To open a terminal via Docker, run <code>docker-compose exec php sh</code> in the project directory.
            </p>

                About
            </h2>
            <p>
                Symlex is maintained by <a href="https://blog.liquidbytes.net/about/" target="_blank">Michael Mayer</a> and
                aims to simplify agile Web development by providing a working system that promotes best practices by example.
                Michael released his <a href="http://freshmeat.sourceforge.net/projects/awf" target="_blank">first PHP framework</a> in 2001 and
                has worked with various major framework vendors in the past.
                Building this would not have been possible without a lot of prior work by other developers.
                Thank you to those and everyone who contributed!
            </p>
